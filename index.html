        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Anusha Dharmasena.

          I am a 31-year-old Software Engineer, originally from
          Sri Lanka, and I've been developing software for over 8 years.

          I moved to Australia at the beginning of 2016 with my family.

          We live in a South Eastern suburb of Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love lots of things: programming, blogging, learning, reading about new tech in the world of PCs and playing PC games to name a few.

          Nowadays I spend my leisure time learning new web development because I want to move in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I havea a son and a daughter and they are very young.

          That's my son with me in the photo, which was shot at the Brighton beach on a
          lovely evening.

      <div class="row" id="career">
        <h2>Career at a glance</h2>
        <h3>First couple of years - Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing university, I joined a software company in Sri Lanka which had its HQ in Japan.

          For the first couple of years, I worked on a few web projects with technologies
          that would be considered very old in today's world.

          After that, I was tranferred to its HQ in Japan to work on the good stuff.
        </p>
        <h3>Next five and a half years - Japan</h3>
        <p>
          I spent about five and a half years in Japan, where I mainly developed
          printer driver related products for <a href="http://canon.jp/">Canon Inc</a>.

          <em>Printer drivers</em>?

          That sounds unexciting!

          Yes, but I learned a lot of things when I was in Japan.

          I did not work at Canon; Canon simply outsourced many of their printer
          driver related projects to the company I worked for.

          However, my final year in Japan, I was deployed to one of Canon's technical centres to
          work on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/print/v4-printer-driver">
          Windows V4 Printer Driver</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most interesting project that I was part of when I was in Japan was a protytype product
          for a concept Canon was bringing to the market.

          I would call it "The <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> project".

          Sadly, it was a very secretive project, so I cannot speak much about it in public.

          What we built was a PDF to SVG converter, but there were almost impossible requirements.

          To name a few, the resulting SVG file had to be
          indistinguishable from the original PDF document pixel-to-pixel when rendered,
          be smaller in payload and
          render faster in a web browser!

          None of the tools available in the market could do this.

          By now, that conceppt could probably be a reality and perhaps I can talk about it; however
          there is no way to know as it was not targeted at the general consumer.

          It was my <strong>first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Agile</a>
          project</strong>, and I was a main designer/developer of the team, right from its inception.
        </p>
        <h3 id='career-aus'>First year after moving to Australia</h3>
        <p>
          Soon after I moved to Melbourne, I found a job through a referral.

          Despite being hired as an Embedded Software Engineer, I was asigned to developing a <strong>React.js</strong>
          web app, the purpose I probably should not talk about in public.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned React.js stuff while on-the-job as well as during my leisure; and I still do.

          The deeper I dug into React.js, the more I fell in love with it.

          It's official: I want to move into web development full time.

          This is also what made me want to design this website.

          But this is just a hobby project and will - hopefully - constantly evolve.

          Until I come up with a nicer <em>web</em> way to present my résumé, you'll have to do with a <em>PDF version</em> of it, which can be downloaded from
