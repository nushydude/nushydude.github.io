        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Anusha Dharmasena.

          I am a 31-year-old Software Engineer, originally from
          Sri Lanka, with more than 8 years of experience in the field.

          I currently live in Melbourne (yes, that's in Australia) with my family.

          In fact, we moved here only a few months ago!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I moved to Melbourne, I used to live in Japan for about two
          thirds of my career.

          When I was there, I developed printer driver related products for
          <a href="http://canon.jp/">Canon Inc.</a>

          I did not work at Canon; I worked for a company in Canon group of
          companies; at least, that's how they classified it.

          I was actively involved in developing the latest
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/print/v4-printer-driver">
          Windows V4 Printer Driver</a> in its infant stages.

          I believe that Canon has <em>finally</em> switched to the V4 driver
          for their printers, entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the most important project in the point of view of
          my career, which I would call the "<abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> project",
          cannot be discussed in detail as it was a prototype product back them.

          Now it probably is in production; there is no way to know as it was
          not targeted at the general consumer.

          It was my <strong>first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Agile</a>
          project</strong>, and I was a main
          designer and developer of its team, right from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love programming, blogging and learning new things.

          Currently I am developing a <strong>React.js</strong> application at work, which has inspired me to move into
          web development.

          Web development is cool!

          That's actually what made me want to design a website for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am married and we have two kids: a son and a daughter and they are so young.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love playing games - especially <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr>
          games - on my PC, however with kids, it is a bit difficult to find time.

          And my PC needs a bit of upgrading to play the latest games.

          I love (well, loved) playing cricket and still watch them on TV.
