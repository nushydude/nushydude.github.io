          About me
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Anusha Dharmasena.

          I am a 31-year-old Software Engineer, originally from
          Sri Lanka, and I've been developing software for over 8 years.

          I moved to Australia at the beginning of 2016 with my family.

          We live in Oakleigh East, a South Eastern suburb of Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love lots of things: programming, blogging, learning, 
          reading about PC hardware related news and playing Crysis 3 on the PC, to name a few.

          Nowadays, I spend my leisure time mostly learning about the web technologies 
          such as React and Node.js, because I want to move in that direction in my career as 
          a developer.

          Career in brief
        </h2>
        <h3>In Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing university, I joined a software company in Sri Lanka which had its HQ in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first couple of years, I worked on a few web projects with legacy technologies such as PHP, MySQL and Apache.

          After working there for a couple of years, I was tranferred to the HQ to work on the good stuff.
        </p>
        <h3>In Japan</h3>
        <p>
          I spent about five and a half years in Japan, where I was worked on
          printer driver related projects, which were outsourced to us by <a href="http://canon.jp/">
          Canon Inc</a>.

          The projects which I was assigned to at the beginning, namely the V3 printer driver and the XPS printer driver, were mature projects. 
            
          Thus, they weren't as exciting as I would have liked.
        </p>
        <p>
          After almost 3 years of working in maintenance projects, I was finally given a chance to develop a product from the scratch.

          I would call it "The <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> project".

          Basically, the goal of the project was to build a PDF to SVG converter.

          It might sound simple, but the generated SVG files had to conform to strict regulations.

          None of the PDF to SVG conversion tools available in the market at the time could achieve what we wanted, which was why the project materialised in the first place.

          It was my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Agile</a>
          project, and I was a main designer/developer.

          The SVG project had two major parts - the part two was about converting the SVG file 
          back to PDF.

          Before the phase 2 of the project materialised, I was detatched from the SVG team to work on a 
          project which was more important, because of my understanding of the XPS driver's source code.
        </p>
        <p>
          This important project was the 
          <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/print/v4-printer-driver">
          Windows V4 Printer Driver</a> project, which happened to be an Agile project as well.

          A team of four from my company, including myself, was deployed to the technical centre in
          Musashi Kosugi to work on the project.

          The goal was to port all the necessary features from the to-be-phased-out V3 driver to the 
          new V4 driver before mid 2016, because Microsoft was planning to discontinue supporting 
          the old GDI printer driver architecture going forward.

          We reached the milestones much earlier than the management anticipated, which was relieving
          because I could bid farewell to Japan without hurting the progress of the project.
        </p>

        <h3 id='career-aus'>In Australia</h3>
        <p>
          Soon after I moved to Melbourne, I found a job through a referral.

          Despite being hired as an Embedded Software Engineer, I was asigned to develop a 
          <strong>React.js</strong> web interface for an upcoming, super complicated product.

          This was my first ever experience working with a JavaScript framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started learning about React.js from this point and I am still learning new things every day.

          The deeper I dug into React.js, I fell in love with it.

          For whatever reason, it felt more enjoyable to play around React.

          It's possibly because I always wanted to move into UI design, however I did not get the 
          opportunity to do that when I was working printer drivers.

          At my current work place, I have all the freedom to learn, experiment and innovate.
