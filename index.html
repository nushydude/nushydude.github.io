          A little bit about me
        </h2>
        <p>
          My name is Anusha Dharmasena.

          I am a 31-year-old Software Engineer, originally from
          Sri Lanka, and I've been developing software for over 8 years.

          I moved to Australia at the beginning of 2016 with my family.

          We live in a South Eastern suburb of Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love lots of things: programming, blogging, learning, reading about new tech in the world of PCs and playing PC games to name a few.

          Nowadays I spend my leisure time learning new web development because I want to move in that direction.

          Career at a glance
        </h2>
        <h3>First couple of years - Sri Lanka</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing university, I joined a software company in Sri Lanka which had its HQ in Japan.

          For the first couple of years, I worked on a few web projects with legacy technologies.

          After working there for a couple of years, I was tranferred to Japan to work on the good stuff,
          as was stated in my contract.

          That was the reason for joining this company in the first place.
        </p>
        <h3>Next five and a half years - Japan</h3>
        <p>
          I spent about five and a half years in Japan, where I mainly was involved in
          printer driver related projects, which were outsourced to us by <a href="http://canon.jp/">Canon Inc</a>.

          The projects which I was assigned to initially, were in their maintenance phases; namely the V3 printer driver
          and the XPS printer driver, so it was a bit boring.
        </p>
        <p>
          After almost 3 years of working in those projects, I was finally given a chance to develop a product from the scratch.

          I would call it "The <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> project".

          Basically what we built was a PDF to SVG converter, but it had very strict requirements.

          None of the PDF to SVG conversion tools that were available in the market could achieve what we wanted, which was
          why the project materialised.

          It was my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Agile</a>
          project, and I was a main designer/developer of the team right from its inception.

          The SVG project had two major parts - the part two was about converting the SVG file back to PDF.

          Before they started the part two, I was detatched from the team to work on an urgent project,
          because of my experience developing the XPS driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          This important project was the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/print/v4-printer-driver">
          Windows V4 Printer Driver</a> project, which was also an Agile project.

          A team of four from my company, including me, was deployed to Canon's Musashi Kosugi technical
          centre to work on the project.

          The goal was to port all the necessary features from the V3 driver to the V4 driver before
          mid 2016, because Microsoft was planning to discontinue supporting the old GDI architecture in Windows.

          We reached the milestones way faster than the management predicted, which was relieving
          because I could leave Japan without hurting the project.
        </p>

        <h3 id='career-aus'>First year after moving to Australia</h3>
        <p>
          Soon after I moved to Melbourne, I found a job through a referral.

          Despite being hired as an Embedded Software Engineer, I was asigned to develop a <strong>React.js</strong>
          web interface for an upcoming product.

          This was my first ever experience working with a JavaScript framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned React.js stuff while on-the-job as well as during my leisure; and I still do.

          The deeper I dug into React.js, the more I fell in love with it.

          <em>It's official: I want to move into web development full time.</em>

          This is also what made me want to design this hopefully constantly evolving website.
